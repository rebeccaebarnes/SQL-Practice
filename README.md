# SQL Lessons
This course work was completed as part of the materials provided in Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

## Overview
The material progresses from basic SQL syntax to advanced usage. The material uses an imagined database for a paper company Parch & Posey. All queries were completed using this database within a Jupyter notebook to facilitate note taking. 

Concepts covered: 
1. SQL Basics (SELECT, FROM, LIMIT, ORDER BY, WHERE, LIKE, IN, logical operators)
2. Basic Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
3. Aggregations (COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG, GROUP BY, DISTINCT, HAVING, DATE, CASE)
4. Subqueries and Temporary Tables (including WITH)
5. Data Cleaning (POSITION, STRPOS, SUBSTR, CONCAT, CAST, COALESCE)
6. Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, aggregates, aliases, percentiles)
7. Advanced Joins (FULL OUTER, UNION, SELF)

## Technologies Used
- SQL
- Python
- Libraries: sqlalchemy, pandas, glob
